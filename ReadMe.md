# Java Design Patterns 

Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development

Design patterns have 2 main uses in software development:

1.	Provide astandard terminology and are specific to a particular scenario

2.	Best practice to solving certain problems faced during software development


## Pattern Description

### Creational Patterns:
	These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.

### Structural Patterns:
    These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.  

###	Behaviourl Patterns:
	These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects |
	
### J2EE Patterns:
	These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier. These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.
